                                        <li>Independence means absence of any link (personal or professional relations) between a Mediator, the parties, their consultants and their family members.</li>
                                        <li>Impartiality means a Mediator's attitude cannot give preference to a party to the detriment of another party.</li>
                                        <li>Neutrality refers to the Mediator's position, which cannot have a direct financial or other interest in the mediation outcome.</li>

                                        <li>a Mediator should be aware of and avoid the potential for bias based on the parties' backgrounds, personal attributes, or conduct during the session.</li>
                                        <li>a Mediator should have no preference based on any preexisting knowledge of, or opinion about, the merits of the dispute being mediated.</li>
                                        <li>a Mediator should withdraw if an apparent conflict of interest exists that casts serious doubt on the

                                    <h4 class="py-2 text-center">COMPETENCE:</h4>

                                    <p>A Mediator must be properly trained and stay up to date with developments in mediation techniques and
                                    settlements of conflicts.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator must prepare before the mediation session by reviewing any statements or documents
                                    submitted by the partes.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should refuse to serve or withdraw from the mediation if the Mediator becomes physically or
                                    mentally unable to meet the reasonable expectations of the parties.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator shall refuse an appointment if they believe they are not qualified or capable of conducting a
                                    mediation.</p>

                                    <h4 class="py-2 text-center">CONFIDENTIALITY:</h4>

                                    <p>It is crucial that the Mediator and all parties have a clear understanding as to confidentiality before the
                                    mediation begins.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator shall not disclose confidential information without permission of all parties or unless required
                                    by force of law.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator shall treat as confidential any information arising within or from a mediation or that comes
                                    into their knowledge because of the Mediator being associated with the parties or the mediation.</p>

                                    <p>Any information provided to the Mediator by one of the parties and stated as confidential shall not be
                                    disclosed to the other parties without consent of the divulging party.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator must not use confidential information acquired during the mediation for personal advantage
                                    or advantage for others, or to affect adversely the interests of the parties or any other person.</p>

                                    <p>If the mediation is being conducted under rules or laws that require disclosure of certain information, a
                                    Mediator should so notify the parties prior to beginning the mediation session or immediately it becomes
                                    apparent to the Mediator that such an occasion has arisen.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator's notes, the parties’ submissions and other documents containing confidential or otherwise
                                    sensitive information will be destroyed immediately after the mediation except for information sufficient
                                    for identifying that a mediation took place and a record of the settlement if it was executed by all parties.</p>

                                    <h4 class="py-2 text-center">PROCEDURE:</h4>

                                    <p>A Mediator shall perform their task with due diligence, independent of the value and type of claim,
                                    number of meetings and remuneration.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator must be satisfied that the parties have deliberated all aspects, considered and understood the
                                    terms and implications of any settlement</p>

                                    <p>The Mediator should, if appropriate, advise the parties to seck legal or other specialised advice.</p>

                                    <p>Mediator does not use their role and perceived influence to manipulate or to direct others towards any
                                    particular outcome.</p>

                                    <p>The Mediator may outline options that are available but it is incumbent upon the parties to adopt or reject
                                    such options.</p>

                                    <p>The parties may withdraw from the mediation at any time without giving any justification and the
                                    Mediator should act and conduct the process in ways that maximize its voluntary nature</p>


                                    <p>Parties usually arrive to the mediation process willingly however, a Mediator may perceive that a party is
                                    being pressured to participate. Then a Mediator should explain clearly to all parties that voluntary
                                    participation is key to the process and they can elect whether the mediation process should proceed. The
                                    Mediator must strive to ensure that the concerns of the reluctant party regarding in the voluntary nature
                                    and their understanding of the process of mediation are fully explained and addressed.</p>

                                    <p>Courtordered mediation often carries in the mind of the participant a perception that they are required to
                                    participate AND to execute a a settlement. The Mediator must ensure that the parties are made aware that
                                    the process is voluntary and a settlement can be reached only if it is to the satisfaction of all parties</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should endeavour to provide a equitable process in which each party is given the opportunity
                                    to participate.</p>

                                    <h4 class="py-2 text-center">VALUES:</h4>
                                    <p>A Mediator shall not put any pressure on the parties to settle or concede any point.</p>

                                    <p>Mediators have no authority to make decisions, and they must be clear on this issue in their dealings with
                                    clients</p>

                                    <p>The Mediator facilitates engagement between the parties, assists the parties to understand the issues and
                                    helps them determine a plan of action.</p>

                                    <p>Mediators understand at all times that authority to choose a course of action rests on the parties</p>

                                    <p>Any attempts to force decisions, or to push for a certain course of action, are ethically unacceptable for a
                                    professional Mediator.</p>

                                    <p>Honesty is vital to mediation. Mediators have an obligation to inform the parties of their professional
                                    background and how payments will be determined.</p>

                                    <p>Mediators should disclose up front all information about the mediation process and its implications, as
                                    well as anything that might compromise the parties’ willingness to continue the process.</p>

                                    <p>Honesty about their perspective on the case, their understanding of the law and any relevant information is
                                    vital to ensure that the parties are able to independently make their own informed decisions.</p>

                                    <p>Honesty means providing additional relevant information that the parties may be unaware of which in the
                                    considered view of the Mediator which would be an impediment to compliance with any possible future
                                    settlement.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator will treat all parties with equal respect irrespective of their gender, age, means or stature in
                                    society.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator respects the specific traditions, ways of life, cultural norms and culture of the parties and secks
                                    to give effect to their wishes. BUT, the only exceptions are where, in the view of the Mediator, a community
                                    specific norm or custom is not legal or compatible with the principles of human self determination,
                                    dignity and/or seeks to place a minor or other disadvantaged person in circumstances where their rights are
                                    contravened.</p>

                                    <p>Whenever a party is given a priority or precedence on a matter, the reason has to be explained clearly for all
                                    parties and agreed to by the other parties.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator cannot mediate where relatives of the Mediator or other persons close to the Mediator are
                                    involved, external support for conducting the mediation should be requested.</p>

                                    <h6 class="py-2 text-center">Suspension Of Limitation Periods:</h6>

                                    <p>The Parties expressly agree that the running of the limitation period regarding the claim that is the subject
                                    matter of the mediation shall be suspended or interrupted as of when, after the dispute has arisen, the
                                    parties agree to use mediation.</p>

                                    <p>Where the mediation has ended without a settlement agreement, the limitation period resumes running
                                    from the time the mediation ended without a settlement agreement, counting from the day succeeding a
                                    declaration of any of the parties or of the Mediator that the mediation is terminated.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should inform all new parties of any previous mediations conducted by the Mediator with any
                                    of the current parties and receive consent or written waiver by all parties to the mediation if they are to
                                    proceed.</p>

                                    <p>Conducting a mediation between parties precludes the Mediator from serving in another dispute resolution
                                    process with any of identical or similar parties.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should exercise caution in accepting items of value, including gifts, services or payments for
                                    snacks or meals, from a party, insurer or counsel to a mediation prior to, during, or after a mediation,
                                    particularly if the items are accepted at such a time and in such a manner as to cast doubt on the integrity
                                    of the mediation process. This does not preclude an exgratia payment made by any party after the
                                    conclusion of the mediation which is disclosed to all parties.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should also avoid conflicts of interest in recommending the services of another dispute
                                    resolution professional, they may provide a list of suitable professionals of five or more in number whom
                                    the Mediator holds in high esteem and advise the parties of their suitability. If a Mediator is unable to
                                    make a personal recommendation without creating a potential or actual conflict of interest, the Mediator
                                    should so advise the parties and refer them to a professional referral service or association.</p>

                                    <h6 class="py-2 text-center">Legal Advice or Representation:</h6>

                                    <p>A Mediator should ensure that the parties understand that the Mediator's role is that of a neutral
                                    facilitator, and ensure that the parties understand that the Mediator is not acting as a legal representative
                                    for any party.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should never offer legal advice to a party or offer general guidance of a party's position or of
                                    the likely outcome in court or arbitration proceedings.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator may indicate the complexity or difficulty, time and resources required to proceed with
                                    alternatives to mediation.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator will not volunteer any recommendations with regard to settlement.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should be particularly sensitive to role differences, therefore if any party is unrepresented by
                                    counsel at the mediation, the Mediator should explain carefully the role of such counsel as being advisory
                                    and not a decision maker and obtain express consent from the unrepresented party(tis) that they are
                                    comfortable proceeding with the mediation.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should ensure that any advertising or other marketing conducted on the Mediator's behalf is
                                    truthful. A Mediator should not guarantee results, especially if such guarantee could be perceived as
                                    favouring one type of disputant or industry over another.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator may advertise the Mediator's qualifications and availability to mediate, but not solicit a specific
                                    case to mediate</p>

                                    <p>If a party and the Mediator cannot agree on the Mediator's fee, the Mediator should decline to serve so that
                                    the parties may obtain another Mediator.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should not permit recordings or transcripts to be made of any of the mediation proceedings.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should maintain confidentiality in the storage and disposal of records and render anonymous
                                    all identifying information when materials are used for research, educational or other informational
                                    purposes.</p>

                                    <p>The Mediators and staff, partners or affiliated Mediators cannot perform other dispute resolution services
                                    for any of the parties before the end of the dispute or within twelve (12) months afier its conclusion.
                                    Nothing hereby prevents the same parties returning to the same mediator to conduct a mediation on an
                                    additional, separate or related matter.</p>

                                    <p>Mediators may not offer mediation services mixed or in conjunction with any other professional or
                                    commercial activities unrelated to dispute resolution.</p>

                                    <p>Mediators may schedule and agree with the parties on a follow up mediation or briefing session where the
                                    parties feel that it may be advantageous at such rate and time and place as the parties may agree, this may
                                    be an informal proceeding and not confined within the mediation rules and procedures.</p>

                                    <p>The Mediator needs to create and maintain strong collaboration with other justice professionals (advocates,
                                    judges, health professionals, social workers, teachers, etc.) in order to enhance their performance.</p>

                                    <p>>Mediators will support each other in their work and all Mediators should utilise opportunities available to
                                    them for exchanging experiences and for sharing successful solutions and other useful information.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should promote their practice, in a professional, truthful and dignified way.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should promote the advancement of mediation by providing and supporting efforts to educate
                                    the public and members of other professions, and by encouraging and participating in research and
                                    publication of accurate information about mediation.</p>

                                    <h4 class="py-2 text-center">TERMINATION OR CONCLUSION:</h4>

                                    <p>Any of the parties may withdraw from the mediation at any time without giving any reason.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator must be satisfied that the parties have considered and understood the terms of any settlement,
                                    and should, if appropriate, advise the parties to seek legal or other specialized advice.</p>

                                    <p>If the Mediator perceives that a party is unable to give informed consent to participation in the process or
                                    to the terms of settlement, the process should not continue until the Mediator is satisfied that such
                                    informed consent has been obtained from the party or the party's duly authorized representative.</p>

                                    <p>1f a Mediator is of the opinion that any party is under duress to accede to any settlement the Mediator may
                                    after consultation with the party privately, declare that the Mediation is unable to proceed without giving
                                    any specific reason which may put any party in jeopardy.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should withdraw from the process if the mediation is being used to further engage in illegal
                                    conduct.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should be aware of the potential need to withdraw from the case if procedural or substantive
                                    unfairness appears to have undermined the integrity of the mediation process.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator should postpone, recess, or terminate the mediation process if it the Mediator believes that the
                                    current continuation of the process is not going to lead to any progress.</p>

                                    <p>A Mediator must terminate the mediation if a party has indicated in private or joint session any
                                    information that would negate any possible settlement.</p>

                                    <p>The settlement agreement is considered as a binding contract in accordance with applicable law.</p>

                                    If an settlement is reached during the mediation, i is reduced to writing and signed by all the parties. The
                                    parties are responsible for the content of the agreement, the Mediator may, with the consent of the parties,
                                    assist in the composition of the settlement or agreement.</p>

                                    <p>Upon request of the partis, a settlement agreement reached as a result of a mediation can be elaborated
                                    upon in a judgment, ruling, decision, authentic instrument or any other form that renders the agreement
                                    enforceable under law, provided that such instrument does not contravene the terms or intention of the
                                    settlement agreement but seeks to elaborate and codify such settlement agreement. Such further document
                                    wil be prepared using professional assistance by the parties of their own volition!</p>
